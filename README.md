# Bugle Champ! EEC172 Final Project
Luna Park & Victoria Lam

## Project Description
The prototype developed in this project is a rhythm game where players use a Nintendo Nunchuk to control the pitch and timing of an on-screen bugle. Similarly to other rhythm games, it includes a song selection menu and a leaderboard for each track. The gameplay cycles through three main stages: song selection, the main game, and leaderboard display. During the main game, players aim to match their pitch and timing as closely as possible to the prescribed notes, or beatmap, in order to earn a high score.

Visually and sonically, the game draws inspiration from retro arcade aesthetics, while its core mechanics are based on the rhythm game Trombone Champ. This project builds upon Trombone Champ by replacing mouse-based pitch control with the Nintendo Nunchuk and introducing an optional microphone input for controlling note timing through blowing.
